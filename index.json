[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Industrial intelligence is becoming the cornerstone of modern manufacturing systems, enabling higher efficiency, resilience, and sustainability across complex production environments. However, the rapid integration of data-driven and AI-based technologies introduces new challenges in terms of safety, reliability, and system-level intelligence. In our Industrial Intelligence \u0026amp; Reliability Lab (IIR Lab), our long-term goal is to build a trustworthy industrial AI foundation via:\ndeveloping data- and AI-driven monitoring frameworks for dynamic and complex industrial systems Modern industrial systems generate massive heterogeneous data from sensors, control loops, and digital platforms. By integrating multivariate statistical analysis, deep learning, and knowledge graphs, we aim to design intelligent monitoring frameworks that provide real-time fault detection, root cause analysis, and predictive maintenance. For example, using temporal graph neural networks, we have demonstrated the ability to capture spatial-temporal dependencies in process flows, enabling early anomaly warnings in chemical plants. Furthermore, we are building closed-loop digital twins that combine process physics and AI inference for online decision-making.\ninvestigating adversarial robustness and defense strategies for industrial AI models under malicious perturbations and cyber-physical attacks Industrial AI systems deployed on the edge or in control environments are increasingly exposed to adversarial threats. Small, carefully crafted input perturbations can mislead AI models into making dangerous decisions. We are studying both white-box and black-box adversarial attack surfaces for anomaly detection and quality prediction models. Leveraging certified defense techniques such as randomized smoothing, ensemble-based uncertainty modeling, and input purification, we design robust pipelines that maintain performance under attacks. A recent case study on rolling mill process monitoring demonstrates our framework’s resilience under simulated cyber-attacks.\nestablishing systematic reliability evaluation and testing protocols to quantify model trustworthiness in real-world industrial settings While industrial AI models show impressive accuracy in laboratory settings, their generalization and reliability in the field are often uncertain. We are developing a reliability assessment toolbox that includes out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, confidence calibration, and lifecycle model testing under various operational conditions. Inspired by software testing frameworks, our protocol includes scenario-based simulation, cross-domain validation, and degradation-aware testing. This toolbox has been applied to CNC fault diagnosis and quality inspection tasks, helping plant engineers identify brittle failure modes before deployment.\nexploring foundation industrial models and autonomous agents for cross-task generalization, collaboration, and adaptive decision-making in intelligent manufacturing With the emergence of large-scale foundation models and autonomous agents, there is a new opportunity to develop general-purpose industrial intelligence. We are training and evaluating large industrial models using multimodal datasets (e.g., process flowsheets, sensor time series, maintenance logs) to support few-shot fault diagnosis and zero-shot control recommendation. Additionally, we are building collaborative multi-agent frameworks that combine digital twins, reinforcement learning, and language interfaces to enable autonomous cooperation among virtual operators, planners, and inspectors. Our pilot study in a discrete manufacturing line has shown promising results in dynamic reconfiguration and workload balancing.\n","date":1745107200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1745107200,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://imphm-lab.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2025-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Industrial intelligence is becoming the cornerstone of modern manufacturing systems, enabling higher efficiency, resilience, and sustainability across complex production environments.
